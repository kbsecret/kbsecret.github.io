# CLI Documentation

KBSecret's CLI is documented using [ronn](https://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/ronn.1.html).

To build the `man`-compatible manpages for yourself, see the
[README](https://github.com/kbsecret/kbsecret/blob/master/README.md). Otherwise, you
can always refer to the HTML versions below:

{% include_relative _manvers.md %}
